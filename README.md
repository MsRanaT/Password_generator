this is a password geneartor by using various modules to shrink the code.
<br>
import string       to use detailed string functions 
import random       to genrate diff/random passwords every time
<br>
<br>
initially it generates password a/c to provided length and give 5 differnet passwords in a single run.
<br>
next i am trying to induce gui and learn about other modules
